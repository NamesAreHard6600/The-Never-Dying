# The-Never-Dying
An Into the Breach Squad Mod

MORE COMING SOON

## TODO:
Maybe make it work with skill build: icon and reduce damage. Exclude kill damage
  Boost preview?? what do I do?? if not, just scrap all previews, but use the current "max health = 100" plan
  armor: Check for armor and if so offset = -1, 0 if also boost
  Purple Glow on 1 damage
Support weapon
Art
Upgrades
Fancy animation for save instead of ping

Passive Upgrades
1. Armor triggers as long as the mech is not on 1 health.

If upgrades are needed:
Armor is good, maybe the arty


GIVE UP:
Simply do the Board:IsDeadly Check. If so, add the fun little icon. Call it good. Not nullified by acid.
